# Uniswap V2 Frontend (Sepolia Testnet)

A Uniswap V2–inspired decentralized exchange (DEX) frontend that interacts with smart contracts deployed on the **Ethereum Sepolia testnet**. The application allows users to connect their wallet, swap ERC-20 tokens, and add or remove liquidity through direct on-chain interactions.

This project is built as a **learning and demo Web3 project**, focusing on frontend–smart contract integration, Web3 UX, and decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts.
